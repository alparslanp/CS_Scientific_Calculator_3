The aim of this program is to use and learn mathematical libraries. "using System.Windows.Forms;" is defined. Calling mathematical functions from math lab.

This program is doing all mathematical equations. Menu strip is used for entension.

By using "this.Width" code on the Form_Load part, this program's interface can be extended. The more you width the program, the more scientific it gets.

Its better to code by hand except for editing on the form page for me.

By clicking on "Converter" this.Width extends the value of 911; so this program allows you to convert celsius to fahrenheit or the opposite and kelvin to celsius, fahrenheit.

By clicking on "Multiplier" this.Width extends the value of 1238; and then you are going to be able to see multipliers of entered value from 1 to 10.

By selecting "View History" showDialog() appears and you can see the whole entered values at new lines and results on the opening form.

However, edit parts are not codded for now, I am planning to add it in the future. :)
